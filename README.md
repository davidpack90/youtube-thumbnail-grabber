## Why Grab YouTube Thumbnails?

## Manual Method

1. Copy the YouTube video URL.  
2. Extract the video ID (after `v=` in the link).  
3. Paste the ID into this URL structure:
4. Open the link in your browser and save the image.

**Problem:** Sometimes YouTube doesnâ€™t keep HD versions, and repeating this process for multiple videos is time-consuming.
